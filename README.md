# Fire Storm

![](firestorm.gif)

It's my first pygame project. It's a simple shooting game. There is a battle ship moving up, down, back and forth with keyboard. Spacebar is to fire bullets. 

## Game Concept 

It's Armageddon. Billions of meteors are coming down from the sky. The battle ship you control is the last battle ship left on Earth and thoudsands of people are boarding in the ship. So you have to save the people. You have to either avoid methor shower or shoot it to break.
